/**
 * This simple demo launches an API that exposes SQL database tables 
 * as REST collection endpoints.  The demo supports full GET,PUT,POST,DELETE
 * operations with an extensive Resource Query Language (RQL) for GET
 * requests.
 * <br>  
 * The demo connects to an in memory H2 sql db that gets initialized from
 * scratch each time this demo is run.  That means you can fully explore
 * modifying operations (PUT,POST,DELETE) and 'break' whatever you want
 * then restart and have a clean demo app again.
 * <br>
 * If you want to explore your own JDBC DB, you can swap the "withDb()"
 * line below with the commented out one and fill in your connection info.
 * Currently, Inversion only ships with MySQL drivers out of the box but
 * has SQL syntax support for MySQL, SqlServer, and PostgreSQL.
 * <br>
 * Northwind is a demo db that has shipped with various Microsoft products
 * for years.  Some of its table designs seem strange or antiquated 
 * compared to modern conventions but it makes a great demo and test
 * specifically because it shows how Inversion can accommodate a broad
 * range of database design patterns.  
 * 
 * @see Demo1SqlDbNorthwind.ddl for more details on the db
 * @see https://github.com/RocketPartners/rocket-inversion for more information 
 *      on building awesome APIs with Inversion
